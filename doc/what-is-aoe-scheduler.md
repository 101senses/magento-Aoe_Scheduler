## What is AOE Scheduler?

AOE Scheduler sits on top of Magento's default cron functionality allowing you to manage the jobs, to visualize the timeline and to get some deeper insight on what's going on. On top of that AOE Scheduler provides some more functionality:

### Features

- **Timeline visualization**: 
- **Cron Management**: Find a list of all jobs defined in the Magento core or in any module installed. You can enable or disable individual jobs, modify them (e.g. edit their schedule) or even create new crons from scratch
- **Parameterized Crons**: Sometimes a simple cron run isn't enough. You might want to use the same cron but with different parameters. Example: Use this to create daily reports and weekly reports with the same job, but different input parameters.
- **Process Management**
- **Cron groups**
- **Cli**
- **Web Service API**
- **Instructions**
- **Compatible with Magento's native cron scheduler**
